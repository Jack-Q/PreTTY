## Project Objectives

[PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) is a popular SSH and telnet client primarily
for Windows which is an important toolkit for server management on Windows. 
However, its old-fashioned user interface and limited extensibility constraints
system administrators to finish their task efficiently. The objective of 
this project is to development a PuTTY like remote connection program
(based on SSH protocol) with pretty and intuitive user interface. This initial 
version is focused on an SSH based remote terminal and an SFTP based remote 
file manager.

After this project, the program shall:

* Successfully execute in at least one of supported platforms
* Successfully connect to remote server and initiate shell access (bash)
* Successfully list, update, and upload files to remote server via GUI

## Assessment Criteria

* Meet major requirements listed in project objectives 
  (which are detailed in design spec)
* Finish project within the project period

## Approach

* create draft version of project resource management plan at initial stage
  and elaborate them progressively
* create work breakdown structure within the first week of project period
* create draft design spec for application that fits in the given resource constraints
* review overall progress weekly, update relevant management plan accordingly
* arrange group study session to let project member get familiar with relevant technologies

## Key Milestones

* by the end of first week:
  * detailed work breakdown structure
  * draft version of resource management plan of project
  * draft version of design spec
* by the end of second week:
  * detailed version of design spec
  * working prototype with limited subset of core functionality (SSH connection)
* by the end of 5 week:
  * working application with complete core functionality
