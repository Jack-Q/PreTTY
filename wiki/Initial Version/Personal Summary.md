Personal Summary
================

* Project Member: Qiao Bo (Jack-Q)
* Role in project: Programmer (Focus on in memory data persistence & core ui services)

## Summary
   
  As a member in Project "PreTTY", the main responsibility of mine is implementation of 
  in memory data persistence and core user interface services. These portion of the project 
  is to provide application programming interface to support the other high-level component 
  which handles user interactions. As there are always lots of dependence relationship 
  between high-level modules and the implementation of the service, delivering an easy to invoke 
  and stable interface is vital from the design phase of the project. Therefore, 
  during the whole project period, I worked closely with other team members to 
  complete a rough design specification and apply modifications to minor modules of interface
  with respect to the demand of other portions of the program.

  Apart from the code works, I also have a relative in depth study of the SSH protocol (RFC4252 - RFC4254)
  (including the [SFTP draft standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-13)). 
  However, owing to the limit of time, only a limited aspects of the protocol are applicable to 
  the result of implementation. Maybe these can be applied to further development of PreTTY.

  While eventually, the project did not tightly follow the schedule established
  in the initial phase of the project, most goals of the project plans are achieved.
  As a programmer in this team, the success of delivering of the application is 
  still highly relevant to management process of this project.

## Responsibility in Project

  The responsibility of mine in this project is the implementation of the data 
  persistence and core ui services. Besides, it is also part of the responsibility
  to participant in the design and testing phase with relevant modules and working 
  together with other team members to resolve issues with interfaces. 
  It is required to integrate these services with high level modules.


## Contribution to project

  Implement core modules of the project and delivering the following entries in 
  source code base of the project (hosted in GitHub currently)
  
  
  - [`/app/services`](https://github.com/Jack-Q/PreTTY/tree/master/app/overlay): core services that provide interface for other modules
  - [`/app/model`](https://github.com/Jack-Q/PreTTY/tree/master/app/model): persistence and in memory data model
  - [`/app/overlay`](https://github.com/Jack-Q/PreTTY/tree/master/app/overlay) (partial): participant in these portion to negotiate the interface

  Before the start of implementation phase, I also set-up and configured the
   framework of this project, which became the basis of further development of the project.

  Apart from the task in duty, I also done some artwork for the project with cooperation 
  of team designer. 



## Experience gained form this project

  The implementation of the project is a valuable experience of user centered 
  desktop application with focus of usability and user experiences. 
  Some functions like the bubbling transition effect that are implemented in a 
  application level to provide convenient interface for other modules of the project.
  As the project also involves lots of frontend development techniques, it is 
  also a consolidation of my skills of development in those aspects.



## Lessons learned form this project

  The participation of this project taught me a lot about the requirement of 
  managerial process in a software project, yet eventually the managerial 
  process still suffered from a lot of issues. For future project, the management process requires 
  much more focuses than this one. We proposed a considerable rational plan for 
  this project in its initial phase while finally diverged in some extends out of our expections.

  Another valuable lesson is that the design process should not be limited to 
  a relative small group of team members. Only those design plans proposed by 
  the whole team is the most acceptable version. We have had lots of modification to
  our initial design, yet they were approved by the whole team.


##  Acknowledgement

  First of all, I would express my sincere thanks to the whole team, especially the project manager.
  While the project managerial process was not quite successful, the contributions of 
  project manager to the project are still the most important factor that 
  led to the result of the project. Besides, I would also thanks to
  Professor Song for providing relevant guides to the management of the project.
